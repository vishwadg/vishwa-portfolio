Hello everyone in this blog we will explore the different ways of building Android mobile apps. We will build a simple app that will have Login Screen using Java (XML), and Kotlin (ComposeUI) and see what’s the difference and benefits. 

I hope by the end of the blog you will be able to decide which one you will use in your project by comparing and finding the features of each. We will start by creating a Login form using XML and implementing it in Java & XML and using ComposeUI in Kotlin.
